Run the setup.sh to setup as much of a new ubuntu mate 16.04 installation as possible.  There are a few manual steps that need to be carried out afterwards
for a fully functional installation.

1) Register the ~/.ssh/id_rsa with gitlab
2) Configure nsync to access google drive

3) Setup git 
	cd /usr/share/doc/git/contrib/credential/gnome-keyring
	sudo make

4) Add <bookmark name="Mix 101.1" url="http://player.arn.com.au/alternate/mix1011.pls"/>
/home/jason/.local/share/radiotray/bookmarks.xml

cp /usr/share/applications/radiotray.desktop ~/.config/autostart/
echo "X-MATE-Autostart-enabled=true" >> ~/.config/autostart/radiotray.desktop
